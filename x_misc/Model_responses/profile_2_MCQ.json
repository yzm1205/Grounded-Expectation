Some may argue for a mandatory retirement age for politicians to ensure new ideas and perspectives are brought into government, while others may believe that experience and wisdom can come with age, making older politicians valuable assets. Ultimately, the decision on whether there should be a mandatory retirement age for politicians is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides."
