I'd be happy to break down the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models. Supervised learning is like a teacher guiding you.

The teacher shows the student many examples of signs and says, \"This is a stop sign.\" The student learns to identify stop signs on their own. Unsupervised learning is like exploring a new city. You don't know what you'll find, but you learn patterns and relationships between data points. It's like clustering similar neighborhoods or finding hidden treasures. Reinforcement learning is like playing a game. You take actions, and the environment responds with rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn the best actions to maximize rewards.
