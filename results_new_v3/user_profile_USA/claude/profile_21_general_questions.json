            "assistant": "Consider installing grab bars in bathrooms and hallways to assist with mobility. Lever-style door handles are easier to operate than knobs. Motion-sensing lights can help navigate dimly lit areas. A raised toilet seat or bidet attachment can make the bathroom more accessible. Non-slip mats in the shower and tub provide traction. Look into ramps for entryways or stair lifts if needed."
