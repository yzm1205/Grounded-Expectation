            "assistant": "Creating a budget and sticking to it is key. Track your expenses and identify areas to cut back, like dining out or subscription services. Automating savings by setting up direct deposits can make it easier. Take advantage of employer-sponsored retirement plans and contribute at least enough to get the full employer match. Building an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of living expenses provides a financial safety net."
