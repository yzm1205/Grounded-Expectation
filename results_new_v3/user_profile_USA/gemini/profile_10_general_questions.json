As it expanded, the universe cooled, allowing particles to form and eventually giving rise to galaxies, stars, and all matter as we know it.\n\n2. **Steady-State Theory**: Once a popular theory, it proposed that the universe has always existed in a continuous state of expansion, with new matter constantly being created to replace what is lost. However, observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation have largely discredited this theory.\n\n3. **Cosmological Constant**: Introduced by Einstein in his theory of general relativity, the cosmological constant represents a repulsive force that counteracts the gravitational attraction between galaxies. This concept forms the basis of the Lambda-CDM model, which incorporates dark energy to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe."
