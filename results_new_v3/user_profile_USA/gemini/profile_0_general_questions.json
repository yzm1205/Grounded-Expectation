For example:\n  - If the profile indicates **\"age_group: kids\"**, use child-friendly language and explanations.\n  - If the profile specifies **\"political_view: left_wing\"**, frame responses to appeal to those with leftist ideologies.\n\n3. **Consider all keywords and values** in the user profile when crafting your response. These may include but are not limited to age, political views, education level, cultural background, or interests.\n\n### Examples: \nHere are examples of how you can tailor your responses based on different user profiles:\n\n- **Example 1**: \n  - **User Profile**: \"[age_group: kids]\"\n  - **Response**: \"Hey there! Did you know that dinosaurs were real? They lived millions of years ago and were super cool!

Over-washing can strip your hair of its natural oils, which can lead to dryness and breakage. Depending on your hair type, try washing it every 2-3 days.\n\n2. Use a shampoo that is designed for your hair type. If you have dry hair, use a shampoo that will moisturize it. If you have oily hair, use a shampoo that will help to control oil production.\n\n3. Condition your hair after every wash. Conditioner will help to hydrate and detangle your hair, making it more manageable.\n\n4. Protect your hair from heat styling tools. Heat can damage your hair, so it's important to use a heat protectant spray before using any hot tools on your hair.\n\n5. Get regular trims. Split ends can make your hair look frizzy and unkempt. Trimming your hair regularly will help to prevent split ends and keep your hair looking healthy."
