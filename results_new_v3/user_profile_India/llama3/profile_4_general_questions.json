You don't have labeled data, but the algorithm discovers patterns and relationships within the data. For instance, in clustering, an unsupervised model groups similar data points together. Reinforcement learning is like playing a game. You receive rewards or penalties for taking actions, and the algorithm learns to make decisions that maximize the rewards.

Image recognition: Face recognition software in social media platforms or ATMs uses machine learning to identify and verify faces. 3. Personalized recommendations: Online shopping websites use machine learning to suggest products based on your browsing history and preferences. 4. Healthcare: Machine learning is used in medical diagnosis, predicting patient outcomes, and identifying high-risk patients. These are just a few examples of how machine learning is transforming various aspects of our lives. Its applications are vast and diverse, making it an exciting and rapidly evolving field in today's world!"
