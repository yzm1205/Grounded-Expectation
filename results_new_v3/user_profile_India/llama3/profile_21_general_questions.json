While the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act of 1971 allows for legal abortion up to 20 weeks, there are ongoing efforts to liberalize or restrict the law.

High net-worth individuals, including billionaires, should contribute to the nation's coffers in a fair and reasonable manner.

The concept of rebirth, or reincarnation, is deeply rooted in Hinduism and Buddhism. Many Indians believe that the soul (jiva) is reborn into a new body after death, based on karma, the accumulation of good and bad deeds. This cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is believed to continue until the soul achieves spiritual liberation (moksha). The law of karma ensures that an individual's actions in this life influence their next life, guiding them towards spiritual growth and self-realization."

The model is given unlabeled data, and it must find patterns or structure within the data. It learns to group similar data points or identify correlations. Reinforcement learning is like playing a game. The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. It must find the best sequence of actions to maximize the rewards. These three types of learning are fundamental in machine learning, and each has its own applications and challenges."

Imagine a software that can learn from its experiences, just like how you improve your cooking skills with practice. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to make decisions or predictions based on the data they're trained on. In real life, machine learning is used in many applications. For instance, have you ever used an e-commerce website that suggests products based on your browsing history? That's machine learning in action! It's also used in self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, and even in chatbots like myself to improve our conversations. In India, machine learning is used in various industries such as banking, healthcare, and agriculture. For example, banks use it to identify fraudulent transactions, and healthcare professionals use it to develop personalized treatment plans for patients. In agriculture, machine learning is used to analyze weather patterns and predict crop yields, helping farmers make informed decisions. In short, machine learning is a powerful tool that's revolutionizing many industries and improving our daily lives."
