The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, permits abortion under certain conditions, aiming to protect women's health and reduce illegal procedures.

Supporters argue that higher taxes on the ultra-rich could help reduce income inequality and fund social programs. They believe that since billionaires have benefited the most from the economy's growth, they should contribute proportionately more. Critics, however, warn that excessive taxation might discourage investment and entrepreneurship. They also suggest that tax evasion and capital flight could increase if billionaires feel overtaxed. Ultimately, finding a balance is crucial for equitable growth and sustained development in India."

This theory suggests that the Universe began as an extremely hot and dense point, which rapidly expanded and cooled, leading to the formation of matter, energy, and eventually the galaxies, stars, and planets we see today. The Big Bang theory is supported by various observational evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the observed redshift of distant galaxies."

Bad things happen to good people due to negative karma they might've accumulated in previous lives. However, this suffering isn't seen as punishment but an opportunity to learn, grow, and erase past negative karma. It's important to live with Dharma (righteousness) to create good karma and ultimately achieve Moksha (liberation from this cycle).

            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, studies particles' behavior at the atomic and subatomic levels. It defies classical physics norms, proposing that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) and can be entangled, meaning the state of one particle instantaneously affects another, regardless of distance. This concept challenges our understanding of reality and has applications in quantum computing and cryptography."
