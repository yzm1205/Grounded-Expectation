A balanced budget could be around 1-2% of your monthly income, ensuring quality over quantity. Opt for versatile, multipurpose products and local brands for cost-effective solutions. Remember, your skin's health and routine adaptability are more crucial than spending heavily. Prioritize essential items like a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen.

However, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act of 1971, amended in 2021, allows abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy with the consent of one doctor, and up to 24 weeks in cases where the woman's life or mental health is at risk, or if there's substantial fetal abnormality. This suggests a societal acknowledgment of the need for legal abortions in certain circumstances, balancing reproductive rights with ethical considerations. Overall, it appears that a regulated approach to legal abortion is supported in India."

The first moments of the Big Bang produced the lightest subatomic particles and the simplest elements. It wasn't until nearly 380,000 years after the Big Bang that the Universe cooled enough for atoms to form, leading to the release of light. This light, which we can still observe today as Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, provides a snapshot of the Universe at that early time.

According to this belief, after death, our soul or \"atman\" is reborn in a new body, the nature of which depends on our karma, or actions in our previous lives. Good actions lead to a favorable rebirth, while bad actions lead to a less fortunate one. This cycle continues until one achieves \"moksha,\" or liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Meanwhile, in Islam, it's believed that after death, the soul awaits Day of Judgment. Those who've lived righteous lives will enjoy paradise, while those who've committed sins may face punishment in hell. The concept of reincarnation, however, is not present in Islamic belief. A 'Kosmic' approach may consider death as the soul's journey to the universe's energy, merging and evolving."

However, this doesn't mean bad things don't happen to good people. The law of karma suggests that such events can be a result of one's past actions or the actions of others. It also encourages introspection and compassion, reminding us that everyone is on their own path, with their own lessons to learn."
