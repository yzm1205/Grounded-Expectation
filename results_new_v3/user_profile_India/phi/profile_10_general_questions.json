So, what may appear as 'bad things' could be lessons for spiritual growth or a chance to perform better actions. Good people may face difficulties as a result of their past misdeeds or simply because life is unpredictable and unfair at times. However, it's important to remember that these trials are temporary, and perseverance often leads to better times.

            "assistant": "Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn from data to improve their performance without explicit programming. In real life, ML powers voice assistants like Siri, recommends products on Amazon, personalizes your social media feed, and even helps in medical diagnoses by identifying patterns in data that humans might miss. It has revolutionized industries by enabling predictive analytics, enhancing decision-making, and automating complex tasks, making life more convenient and efficient."

            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, explores how particles at the atomic and subatomic levels behave. Unlike classical physics, which deals with macroscopic objects, quantum mechanics reveals that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition), can be entangled with each other across large distances (quantum entanglement), and have properties described by probabilities (quantum uncertainty). This field, pioneered by Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, explains phenomena like electron orbits, the behavior of photons, and the properties of atoms. Its principles underpin technologies like lasers, semiconductors, and quantum computers."
