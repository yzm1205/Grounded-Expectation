The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, allows abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy if there's a risk to the mother's life, or fetal impairment. After 20 weeks, it's permissible with court approval in exceptional cases. Legalizing abortion ensures safe procedures, protecting women's health and lives. It also respects women's reproductive rights, letting them decide on family planning. Continual dialogue is vital to align legal, ethical, and medical aspects with societal values, ensuring comprehensive support for women's choices."

Good deeds lead to a better life, while bad actions result in a less favorable rebirth. This cycle, called Samsara, continues until the soul achieves Moksha, or liberation, breaking free from the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

Karma, a Sanskrit word meaning 'action', suggests that every action has a consequence. Good actions lead to positive results, while bad actions lead to negative outcomes, sometimes in this life and sometimes in future reincarnations. This concept helps many to find meaning and solace, understanding that their actions, knowingly or unknowingly, attract corresponding results. It also encourages people to be mindful of their actions, promoting personal growth and improvement."
