It's believed that every action, good or bad, has consequences that may manifest in this life or future lives. Thus, when bad things happen to good people, it may be a result of their past actions. However, it doesn't imply that they're being punished, rather, it's a part of the cosmic law of cause and effect. The suffering is seen as an opportunity for spiritual growth, purification, and eventually, liberation."

            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, explores the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level in India and globally. It reveals that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) and can be entangled, meaning their properties remain connected regardless of distance. Unlike classical physics, quantum theory incorporates probabilities rather than certainties, as the exact state of a particle cannot be determined beforehand (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). Discoveries in quantum physics have enabled technologies like lasers, semiconductors, and MRI machines."
