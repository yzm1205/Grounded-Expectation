Good deeds lead to positive karma and suffering results from negative karma, a concept derived from ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophies. It's believed that what appears as 'bad things' to some may not be necessarily so; it could be a result of past misdeeds, or even necessary for growth and enlightenment.
