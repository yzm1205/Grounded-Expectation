            "assistant": "Quantum Physics, also known as Quantum Mechanics, explores the behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic level. It's a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales. Unlike classical physics, which deals with larger objects, Quantum Physics introduces concepts like wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement. In simple terms, it means that particles like electrons can exist in multiple states at once, and their properties can be interconnected even over large distances. This fascinating field has revolutionized technology, leading to innovations like lasers, semiconductors, and MRI scanners."
