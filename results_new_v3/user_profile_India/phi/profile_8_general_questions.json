Abortion was legalized in 1971 under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, allowing it up to 20 weeks of pregnancy under specific conditions.

Buddhism shares a similar concept of rebirth, but emphasizes breaking the cycle of suffering. For many Sikhs and Jains, the soul eventually merges with the divine or reaches a state of infinite knowledge, respectively.

Karma suggests that every action has consequences, and the suffering of the virtuous is seen as a result of past deeds, either in this life or previous incarnations. This perspective encourages moral living, compassion, and the understanding that hardships can lead to spiritual growth and eventual liberation. Meanwhile, it also instills hope that suffering is temporary and that good people ultimately receive their due."

            "assistant": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where systems learn from data to improve performance without explicit programming. In real life, it powers recommendation engines like Netflix, detects fraud in banking, personalizes ads on social media, and enhances healthcare through predictive diagnostics. In India, it's used in agriculture to predict crop yields, in traffic management by optimizing routes, and in language translation services to help diverse language speakers."

            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales, like atoms and subatomic particles. It shows that energy is quantized, meaning it exists in discrete units called \"quanta.\" Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) and can be entangled, meaning their states are interconnected regardless of distance. Unlike classical physics, quantum physics is probabilistic, providing a range of likely outcomes, with wave functions describing probabilities. This weird, counterintuitive nature of quantum physics has led to revolutionary technologies like quantum computers and has deepened our understanding of the universe."
