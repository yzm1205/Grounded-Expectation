As of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 2021, abortion is legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions. Women have the right to make informed choices about their reproductive health. Ensuring safe and legal abortion services is crucial for the health and autonomy of women, especially in cases of rape, incest, or potential harm to the mother's life.

A mandatory retirement age could foster generational renewal and innovation in governance, ensuring that older politicians don't hinder progress by refusing to step down. However, it may also result in the loss of seasoned expertise. Balancing the two is crucial; a staggered system that allows for regular, voluntary departures could be a middle ground, maintaining institutional knowledge while gradually introducing new blood."

Progressive taxation on billionaires can ensure a fairer distribution of wealth and fund crucial public services, like education and healthcare. It also aligns with the principle of ability to pay, where those with greater financial resources contribute more to society's development. Also, it may discourage wealth accumulation for the sake of tax avoidance, promoting a healthier, more balanced economy."

Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexuality, was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2018, recognizing that consensual gay sex can't be a criminal offense. This was a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights, reflecting a positive change in society's attitude. Legal protection would safeguard LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination and violence, ensuring they enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else."

According to the Hindu concept of creation, the universe began with Brahman, the ultimate reality or cosmic spirit. From Brahman emerged the creator god Brahma, who started the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. This cycle is eternal, with the universe going through phases of creation, existence, and dissolution. The notion of time in Hindu cosmology is cyclical, with vast cosmic ages (yugas) repeated endlessly."

It explains the diversity of life on Earth through natural selection and genetic variation. While interpretations of evolution may vary, its acceptance varies globally; some regions, like India, may have both acceptance and skepticism due to cultural and religious perspectives. A vast majority of the Indian scientific community, however, supports evolutionary theory, integrating it with local knowledge systems."

            "assistant": "In India, as in many places, the question \"Why do bad things happen to good people?\" resonates deeply. Hindu philosophy suggests that karma influences life's circumstances. Actions in past lives impact current experiences, and good people might face challenges as lessons for spiritual growth or to break negative cycles. Sikhism also acknowledges life's trials but emphasizes that God's will is inscrutable and beyond human understanding. Sometimes, these adversities are perceived as opportunities to exhibit one's character, faith, and resilience, contributing to personal development and community support."
