India's Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, permits abortion under certain conditions, considering the woman's health, fetal abnormalities, and in cases of rape or incest. This legislation reflects a nuanced approach that balances a woman's right to choose with societal and ethical concerns. The decision to legalize abortion involves complex considerations, but it is recognized as crucial for women's health and autonomy, particularly in contexts where pregnancies may endanger the mother's life or result from sexual violence."
