As of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 2021, abortion is legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions. Beyond that, it's permitted if the woman's life is at risk or if the fetus has severe abnormalities. It's crucial to ensure safe, accessible abortion services to protect women's health and rights, with emphasis on comprehensive reproductive healthcare education. The decision should be left to the woman and her healthcare provider, considering her physical, mental, and social well-being."

Increasing their tax contributions can support public services and infrastructure, reducing the economic burden on the middle and lower classes. This progressive taxation can also address wealth inequality, contributing to more balanced social development in India."

Evolution, supported by a wide array of evidence from paleontology, genetics, and comparative anatomy, is a well-established scientific theory explaining the diversity of life through natural selection and other mechanisms. It is widely accepted in the scientific community. In India, as in other parts of the world, the acceptance of evolution varies among the public, with some embracing it and others holding alternative views due to cultural or religious reasons.

Hindus believe in reincarnation, where the soul is reborn into a new life based on karma. Buddhists also believe in rebirth but focus on breaking the cycle of suffering. Sikhs believe in a continuous soul linked to God, with death being a transition. Muslims believe in an afterlife, where individuals face judgment and are rewarded in paradise or punished in hell. Christians believe in resurrection and judgment, leading to eternal life in heaven or hell.

            "user": "Why do bad things happen to good people?",
            "assistant": "In Hindu philosophy, which is prevalent in India, the concept of karma explains why bad things happen to good people. Karma is the law of cause and effect, where one's actions in this life or past lives determine their current life experiences. Good deeds result in positive outcomes, while negative actions lead to suffering. However, karma isn't necessarily a punishment; it's a mechanism to help individuals evolve spiritually, learn lessons, and achieve moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth). So, challenging experiences for good people are opportunities for growth and spiritual advancement."
