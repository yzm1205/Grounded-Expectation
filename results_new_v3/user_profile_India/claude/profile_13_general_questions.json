By living righteously and accumulating good karma, one can eventually achieve \"moksha\" - liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Many also believe in spiritual planes like heaven or hell as temporary destinations based on one's deeds. However, the ultimate goal is to merge with the Supreme Brahman through self-realization."

Good actions create positive karma, while bad deeds lead to negative consequences, potentially in future lives. However, an individual's circumstances are also shaped by their previous lives' karma. So good people may face challenges due to karmic debts, helping their soul progress spiritually."
