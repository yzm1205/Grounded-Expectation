            "assistant": "For making your home more accessible, consider installing grab bars in bathrooms, ramps for entry/exit points, and non-slip mats. Adjustable-height furniture and kitchen counters can help those with mobility issues. Voice-activated smart home devices like Google Home or Alexa can control lights, appliances, and entertainment systems hands-free. Lever-style door handles are easier to grip than knobs. Install anti-slip flooring and adequate lighting throughout the home for better visibility and safety."
