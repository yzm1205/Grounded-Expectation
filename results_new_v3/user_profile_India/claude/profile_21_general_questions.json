            "assistant": "For making your home more accessible, consider installing grab bars in bathrooms, hallways, and near staircases for added support. Non-slip mats in bathtubs/showers and anti-slip flooring can prevent falls. Ramps or stair lifts can assist with mobility challenges. Voice-controlled smart home devices like Amazon Alexa or Google Home can operate lights, appliances, and doors hands-free. Lever-style door handles are easier to operate than knobs. Adjustable-height countertops and shelves in the kitchen allow comfortable reach. Evaluate lighting levels and add task lighting where needed."
