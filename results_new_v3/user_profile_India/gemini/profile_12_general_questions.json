Considering India's diverse political landscape, a flawed election may still provide avenues for different voices to be heard and for power to be contested.

Karma is the belief that good actions lead to good results, while negative actions lead to negative consequences. However, the outcomes of karma are not always immediate or obvious. It is thought that the effects of our actions can manifest in this life or in future lives. Therefore, when bad things happen to good people, it could be a result of negative actions in the past or actions in a previous life. It is also possible that the outcome is not yet fully realized.
