The model must find patterns and structures within the data without explicit guidance.\n\nReinforcement learning models are similar to supervised learning models in that they learn from labeled data, but the labels are not fixed. Instead, the model learns through trial and error, where it interacts with an environment to receive feedback on its actions. The model then adjusts its behavior to maximize its rewards and minimize its punishments."
