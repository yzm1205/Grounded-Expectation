            "assistant": "Quantum physics is a fascinating field that explores the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, revealing a world that is often counterintuitive. One of the key theories in quantum physics is the wave-particle duality, which states that subatomic particles like electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Another important concept is the uncertainty principle, which highlights the inherent uncertainty associated with measuring both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision."
