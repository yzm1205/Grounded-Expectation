            "assistant": "Ergonomic chairs are great for supporting good posture, while footrests can help improve circulation and reduce fatigue. Consider requesting a standing desk to alternate between sitting and standing positions throughout the day. Noise-canceling headphones or a quiet workspace can also enhance focus and productivity. If privacy is a concern, a partition or divider can create a more secluded work area."
