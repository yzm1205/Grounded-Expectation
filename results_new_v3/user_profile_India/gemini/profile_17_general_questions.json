Each block contains a timestamp, a transaction record, and a reference to the previous block.\n\nOnce a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.\n\nThis makes blockchain a secure and tamper-proof way to record transactions. Also, because the blockchain is distributed, there is no central point of failure and the data is simultaneously stored on multiple computers.\n\nThis makes it very difficult to hack or corrupt and particularly useful for recording financial transactions, supply chain management, and other applications where data integrity is important."
