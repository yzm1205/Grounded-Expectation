In this realm, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a concept called superposition. Furthermore, quantum physics involves uncertainty, where you can't exactly predict a particle's state. It has led to technologies like quantum computing. It's a complex but intriguing field that continues to shape our understanding of the universe, even in India's scientific community."
