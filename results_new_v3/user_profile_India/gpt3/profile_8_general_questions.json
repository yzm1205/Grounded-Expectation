In quantum physics, entities like particles can behave as both particles and waves, and their properties are described by probabilities. This field includes principles like superposition, entanglement, and quantization. Quantum physics forms the basis of many modern technologies like lasers and transistors. It's a fascinating area that challenges our traditional understanding of the physical world, offering insights into the fundamental nature of reality at the smallest levels."
