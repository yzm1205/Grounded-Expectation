Concepts like superposition (where particles can be in multiple states at once) and entanglement (where particles can be interconnected regardless of distance) are fundamental. In quantum mechanics, particles are described by wave functions, offering probabilities rather than certainties. This field is crucial for modern technology like computers and lasers. Despite its complexities, quantum physics forms the basis of many scientific breakthroughs, shaping our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level."
