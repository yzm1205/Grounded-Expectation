It is a branch of physics that deals with the smallest particles in the universe, such as atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles. Quantum physics has led to the development of new technologies such as lasers, semiconductors, and nuclear power.\n\nOne of the most important concepts in quantum physics is wave-particle duality. This means that light and matter can behave like both a wave and a particle. For example, light can be diffracted, which is a wave-like behavior, but it can also be absorbed or emitted as a particle, such as a photon.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum physics is the uncertainty principle. This principle states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy. This is because the act of measuring one of these properties inevitably affects the other.\n\nQuantum physics is a complex and challenging subject, but it is also one of the most important branches of physics.
