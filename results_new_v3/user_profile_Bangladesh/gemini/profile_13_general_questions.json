Once a block is filled, it's linked to the previous block, forming a chain. This structure makes it incredibly difficult to alter or manipulate the data, as any changes would require modifying all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchain technology offers several advantages:\n\n- **Decentralization:** Data is not stored in a single location, eliminating the risk of a central point of failure.\n- **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded on the public ledger, providing a complete and auditable history.\n- **Security:** Cryptography and consensus mechanisms ensure the integrity and immutability of the data.\n- **Efficiency:** By eliminating intermediaries, blockchain can streamline processes and reduce costs.\n\nOverall, blockchain has the potential to transform industries such as finance, supply chain management, and healthcare by enhancing trust, transparency, and efficiency."
