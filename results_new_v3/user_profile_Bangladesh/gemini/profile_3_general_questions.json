            "assistant": "Here's a few accommodations that may suit your needs in a workplace environment:\n\n- **Prayer leave:** If your job requires overtime or travel that would conflict with your religious obligations, you may request an adjustment to your schedule or extended leave for religious holidays.\n- **Flexible work hours:** If your job duties allow for it, a flexible schedule can help you balance your personal and professional life. You may be able to start and end your day later or earlier, or take a longer lunch break.\n- **Quiet workspace:** If you find yourself easily distracted in a busy office environment, you may request a quiet workspace, such as a private office or a cubicle in a less noisy area."
