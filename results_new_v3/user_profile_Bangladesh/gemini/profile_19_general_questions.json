These models are trained on a dataset where the input data is labeled with the corresponding output, and the model learns to map the input to the output. Once trained, these models can take new, unseen input data and predict the corresponding output.\n\nUnsupervised learning models learn from unlabeled data, where the input data is not paired with the correct output. These models are trained on a dataset where the input data is not labeled, and the model learns to find patterns and structures in the data. Once trained, these models can be used to cluster data points, reduce dimensionality, or generate new data.\n\nReinforcement learning models learn by interacting with their environment. These models take actions in the environment and receive rewards or penalties based on the outcome of their actions. The model learns to adjust its actions to maximize the rewards it receives. Reinforcement learning is often used in robotics, game-playing, and other applications where the model needs to learn to make decisions in a complex and dynamic environment."

In classical physics, this ball has a specific location & speed. But quantum physics tells us it doesn't have a definite location or speed; it exists as a wave of probabilities.\n\nWhen we observe the particle, its wave function collapses & it takes on a specific location & speed. This is called wave-particle duality.\n\nAnother key concept is quantum entanglement. Two particles can become entangled, meaning their behavior is linked even when separated by large distances.
