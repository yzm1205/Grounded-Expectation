Use a shampoo suitable for your hair type and avoid harsh detergents.\n\n2. **Condition your hair:** Conditioning helps keep your hair hydrated and prevents breakage. Apply conditioner to the ends of your hair, avoiding the roots. Leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly.\n\n3. **Protect your hair from heat:** Excessive heat styling can damage your hair, so use heat protectant sprays when using hair dryers, flat irons, or curling wands.\n\n4. **Trim your hair regularly:** Regular trims remove split ends and prevent further breakage. Aim to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks.\n\n5. **Use natural hair masks:** Natural hair masks can provide deep nourishment to your hair. Try using masks made with coconut oil, olive oil, or avocado.\n\n6. **Eat a healthy diet:** A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals supports healthy hair growth. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals."
