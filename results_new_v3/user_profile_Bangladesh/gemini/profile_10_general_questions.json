For example, in predicting crop yield based on weather data, a model would be trained on historical datasets with yield and weather input, allowing it to make accurate predictions on new data.\n\nUnsupervised learning operates on unlabeled data. Rather than learning the relationship between inputs and outputs, the model finds patterns or structures within the data. For instance, in image compression, an unsupervised model can learn to identify significant features and eliminate redundant information to reduce file size while preserving image quality.\n\nReinforcement learning lies somewhere between these two. The model learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. It seeks to maximize its total reward over time. A classic example is the Q-learning algorithm, where a robot learns to navigate a maze by receiving rewards for reaching the goal and penalties for hitting obstacles."
