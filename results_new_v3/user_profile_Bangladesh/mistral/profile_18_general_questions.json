For example, in Islam, it is believed that after death, the soul is judged and sent to paradise or hell. In Hinduism, the soul undergoes a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, known as samsara. However, these are religious interpretations. From a scientific standpoint, when a person dies, the body decays and returns to nature, but the consciousness, or the essence of who we are, is still debated and not proven. It's a deeply personal and philosophical question that has puzzled humanity for centuries."

In Bangladesh, this concept is often framed within the context of 'Nazar' or 'Evil Eye', a superstitious belief that someone's malicious glance can cause harm. However, from a rational perspective, it's essential to understand that life isn't always fair, and misfortunes can be due to various factors such as circumstances, choices, or simply bad luck. It's crucial to remain resilient and find ways to overcome adversities, remembering that personal growth and learning often come from challenging experiences."
