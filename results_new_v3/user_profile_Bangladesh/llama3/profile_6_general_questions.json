Imagine learning a new skill, like playing a musical instrument. There are three ways to learn: guided, self-discovery, and experimentation. **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, you're given a tutor who provides feedback on your performance, much like a music teacher corrects your notes. The model learns by comparing its predictions with labeled examples, helping it improve accuracy. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning is like discovering new musical patterns on your own. You're given a dataset, and the model must find its own patterns, clusters, or relationships without any guidance or feedback. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning is similar to learning a new instrument through experimentation. You receive feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for your actions, guiding you to make better decisions and improve over time. Think of it as receiving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down for each note you play. These three approaches have different applications in various fields, from image recognition to robotics.
