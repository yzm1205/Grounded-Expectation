            "assistant": "Quantum Physics, also known as Quantum Mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics. It describes nature at the smallest scales, such as molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles. In this realm, many of the classic laws of physics do not apply. Key principles include quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, and superposition. The behavior of particles can only be described by probability and are inherently uncertain, explained by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Quantum Physics underpins modern technologies like lasers, semiconductors, and MRI scanners."
