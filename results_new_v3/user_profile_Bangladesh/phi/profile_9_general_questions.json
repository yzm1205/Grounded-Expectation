            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a branch of physics that deals with particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. Unlike classical physics, where objects follow predictable paths, quantum physics shows that particles can exist in multiple states at once, called superposition. This leads to phenomena like entanglement, where particles remain connected, affecting each other's states regardless of distance. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. Quantum physics forms the basis of technologies like semiconductors and lasers."
