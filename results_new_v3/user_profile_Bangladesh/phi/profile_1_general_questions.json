There are strict laws against abortion, with only a few exceptions, such as risks to the mother's life or cases of fetal impairment. The limited legal access, coupled with the stigmatization of women seeking abortions, can lead to unsafe procedures and health complications. However, considering the high rates of maternal mortality and the often-difficult economic conditions for large families, some argue that safe and legal abortion services could be an important aspect of reproductive health rights for women in Bangladesh."

At this point, all matter and energy were concentrated in an extremely dense and hot state. Then, it rapidly expanded and cooled, leading to the formation of fundamental particles.

One perspective is karma, a concept from our Bengali culture influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism, which suggests that one's actions in this or previous lives determine their current experiences. Another view is that challenges are a part of life's journey, intended to help individuals grow stronger and wiser. Regardless of the cause, it's essential to support each other during difficult times and to remember that often, we don't see the full picture of why something happens."

            "assistant": "Quantum Physics, also known as Quantum Mechanics, is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, like atoms and subatomic particles. It differs from classical physics due to phenomena such as wave-particle duality, superposition, and entanglement. For instance, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and their properties only become definite upon measurement. This counterintuitive science underpins technologies like lasers, semiconductors, and quantum computers. \nTo better understand this complex field, imagine a game of dice. Unlike classical physics, where the dice outcome is determined, in quantum mechanics, it's uncertain until you roll it. That's superposition and uncertainty!"
