            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It's a complex field, but here's a simple explanation: In quantum physics, particles can exist in multiple states at once (superposition), and they can become entangled, meaning the state of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This often-defying reality is vastly different from our everyday experiences and understanding of how things work."

Consider a less popular, more affordable local mobile data plan. Deposit a fixed amount into a savings account regularly. Explore government-subsidized programs for low-income citizens. Invest in community savings groups, or \"Husseinis\", which are common in Bangladesh and can provide financial security. Self-education through community workshops on finance management can also be beneficial."
