            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics describing the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, like atoms and subatomic particles. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality, where particles like electrons exhibit both wave and particle characteristics, and the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously known with precision. This theory has revolutionized technology, leading to advancements in electronics, computing, and medical imaging."
