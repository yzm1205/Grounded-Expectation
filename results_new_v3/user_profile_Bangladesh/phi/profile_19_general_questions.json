            "assistant": "Investing in real estate can be a sound decision for long-term wealth in Bangladesh, considering the growing population and urbanization. However, as a quick guideline, a common rule of thumb is to invest about 20% of your investable assets in real estate. Ensure you do thorough research on locations, property types, and market trends. Also, factor in additional costs like maintenance, taxes, and potential rental income before deciding on the amount to invest."

            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales, like atoms and subatomic particles. It's a bit like the rules of a game played in a very tiny, invisible world. In this world, particles can exist in multiple places at once (superposition), and their properties are not determined until they're observed (wave function collapse). This framework is essential for understanding how the universe works at its core, and has led to technologies like semiconductors and lasers."
