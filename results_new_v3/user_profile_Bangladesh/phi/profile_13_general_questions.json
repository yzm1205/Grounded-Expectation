According to this theory, the Universe began as a hot, dense point nearly 13.8 billion years ago. It then rapidly expanded and cooled, eventually forming galaxies, stars, and planets. Archaeological and historical evidence of this theory includes the observation of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the large scale structure of the cosmos, and the abundance of light elements, all of which match predictions of the Big Bang model. However, interpretations of these phenomena can vary, and the Big Bang theory is still a topic of ongoing research.

The deceased's actions during life determine their afterlife destination. Souls enter Barzakh, a state between worlds, awaiting judgment Day (Qiyamah). Righteous souls may enter Jannah (Paradise), experiencing eternal bliss. Conversely, those who committed sins may face Jahannam (Hell), enduring suffering. Ultimately, all souls will be reunited with God and receive final justice. This belief emphasizes moral living and compassion towards others."

From a Buddhist standpoint, suffering is a part of life, influenced by karma from past lives. In Islam, life tests individuals' faith and patience, with difficulties meant as a means to grow and draw closer to Allah. For Bengalis, remembering the martyrs of the Liberation War instills hope that despite adversity, good will triumph. Praying for strength and understanding, we strive to transform these challenges into opportunities for personal and communal growth."

            "assistant": "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, studies the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, like atoms and subatomic particles. It shows that energy and matter behave both like particles and waves. Uncertainty principle and superposition are key concepts. For example, Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment illustrates superposition, where a cat is simultaneously alive and dead until observed. Quantum entanglement connects particles instantaneously, regardless of distance. This science has led to technological advances like lasers and transistors, impacting our daily lives."
