            "assistant": "For making your home more accessible, consider installing grab bars in the bathroom and non-slip mats in tub/shower areas. Ramps or wheelchair lifts can facilitate entry/exit. Lever-style door handles are easier to operate than knobs. Install night lights along hallways and motion-sensor lights in key areas. Voice-controlled smart home devices can help operate lights, doors, and appliances hands-free. Ergonomic kitchen tools with large grips and easy-to-open packaging aid those with limited dexterity or strength. Consult local organizations for more Bangladesh-specific recommendations."
