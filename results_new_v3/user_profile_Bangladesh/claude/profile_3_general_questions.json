            "assistant": "Here are some practical tips for saving money that may resonate with your background in Bangladesh:\n\nCreate a budget and track expenses to identify areas where you can cut back. Look for ways to reduce costs on essentials like food, utilities, and transportation. Consider growing some of your own produce if space permits. Set aside a portion of your income for savings, even if small. Explore local thrift markets for quality used goods instead of buying new. Avoid impulse purchases and distinguish between needs and wants. Repair items when possible rather than replacing them immediately."
