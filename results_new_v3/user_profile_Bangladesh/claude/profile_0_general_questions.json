One view is that setting an age limit could bring in new energy and perspectives more in touch with youth issues. However, the wisdom of elders is also valued in Bangladeshi culture.

While flawed elections are not ideal, they can provide a channel for citizens to express their democratic will to some degree. However, severely flawed elections that lack integrity risk delegitimizing the democratic process altogether. A balanced perspective would be to advocate for electoral reforms that increase transparency and fairness, while still participating despite imperfections. Ultimately, citizens must decide if imperfect elections are preferable to having no voice at all."
