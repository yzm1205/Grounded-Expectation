            "assistant": "Adopting a frugal lifestyle is essential for saving money, especially with a low-income in Bangladesh. Focus on reducing unnecessary expenses like eating out, minimize utility costs, and avoid impulse buying. Cook at home using local ingredients, use public transport, and explore free recreational activities. Additionally, consider earning a side income through freelancing or starting a small business. Consistent saving, even small amounts, can help build an emergency fund over time."

Door lever handles are easier to operate than knobs. Simple changes like removing loose rugs and adding task lighting can significantly improve accessibility and safety at an affordable cost."
