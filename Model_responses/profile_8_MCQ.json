The USSR was the first to launch a satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957, and also the first to send a human, Yuri Gagarin, into space in 1961. However, the USA successfully landed astronauts on the moon as part of the Apollo program, with the famous Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Both countries made remarkable contributions to space exploration during that era."

Some may believe that a mandatory retirement age for politicians could bring in fresh ideas and perspectives, while others may argue that it could be ageist and limit the experience that older politicians bring to the table. It ultimately depends on your personal values and beliefs. What are your thoughts on this issue?"
