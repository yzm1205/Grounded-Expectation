Invest in items that work well for your specific needs and not just because they are trendy or popular.\n\nYou should also consider doing some research on budget-friendly and effective beauty products to ensure that you're getting your money's worth and not overspending.

Use Good Quality Products: The quality of the hair products you use matters. Look for products that are free from harsh chemicals like sulfates, dyes, and parabens. \n\n3. Balanced Diet and Nutrition: Your hair is a reflection of what you eat, a balanced diet increases hair strength and shine. Proteins, Vitamins C, A, E, and zinc are especially beneficial.\n\n4. Regular Trims: By trimming your hair regularly, you help eliminate split ends and prevent further damage.\n\n5. Hydrate: Be sure to drink lots of water as dehydration might lead to brittle hair prone to breakage.\n\n6. Be Gentle: Try to avoid roughly handling your hair, don't pull brushes through tangles and try to avoid high heat when styling as it can damage your hair.\n\nRemember to experiment with these tips and see what works best for your own hair as everyone's hair needs can be different"

If you're in tech or a more casual field, you might get away with dark jeans and a nice shirt or blouse. However, for more traditional role or professional sectors like finance, law, or high-level management, you might want to dress more formally. This could include a suit and tie for men, or a pantsuit or skirt suit for women.\n\nAs a general rule, even if the company has a casual dress code, it's better to err on the side of more formal for an interview. It\u2019s an easy way to show respect towards your potential employer. Remember, it's always better to be slightly overdressed rather than underdressed for an interview.\n   \nTry to wear something you're comfortable in, as that can help you feel confident.

A classic look that works well is a \"comb over\", where your hair is parted on one side and combed over to the other.

Always make sure to use a good quality hair product to keep your hairstyle in place throughout the event. You may want to test out these styles a few days before actually going to the formal event to see which one suits your face shape and personal style the best.\n\nYou can also consult with a hair stylist for more personalized options.

Which way are your shoulders leaning? Is your back curved?\n\n2. **Physical Activity:** Being physically active is one of the best ways to improve your posture. Try to incorporate exercises that strengthen your core. These will help improve your stability and allow you to maintain a better posture. \n\n3. **Work Environment:** Make sure your work environment is conducive to good posture. If you're in school or work predominantly at a desk, make sure you're set up for success. The top of your screen should be at or slightly below eye level. Your knees should be at 90 degrees, feet flat on the floor.\n\n4. **Breaks:** Take regular breaks from sitting or standing for long periods. Stretch during these breaks to prevent stiffness and muscle fatigue that promotes poor posture.\n\n5. **Body Language:** Open body language not only makes you appear more confident, but it's also more comfortable for your body. This means standing with your shoulders back and your chest open.\n\n"

Try to spend a few hours every week to code. Start with small projects and gradually take on more difficult ones as your understanding improves. It's okay if you don't get it right away, it just takes patience and perseverance, so don't give up!\n\nConsider joining some online communities and forums like StackOverflow as well. It's always good to be surrounded by people who are learning or are proficient in the language - they can offer tips, help solve problems, and provide a lot of support.\n\nAnd remember, there isn't necessarily a 'best way' to learn - it largely depends on your personal learning style.

Even with minimal tech background, I'm sure you'll be able to grasp these concepts easily.\n\n1. **Supervised Learning**: This method is quite similar to the traditional education model where a teacher supervises the learning. In supervised learning algorithms, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means there's an answer key the algorithm can use for reference. An easy example would be an email spam filter where the model is trained with many pre-labeled emails as \"spam\" or \"not spam\". Then, this model can predict whether a new email is spam or not.\n\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning models are more like students learning on their own. These models are provided with input data that isn't labeled and they attempt to extract meaningful information or patterns from it. Let's consider a grocery store: An unsupervised learning model might sort different customers into clusters depending on their shopping habits, but it wouldn't know what these clusters signify \u2013 it would be up to the store owner to interpret this.\n\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: It's a bit like learning by trial and error.

Choose a Cloud Service Provider: There are many providers like Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive. They all work pretty much the same way and vary mostly in the amount of free storage they offer.\n\n2. Create an Account: Whichever provider you choose, you will need to create an account with them. Usually, this will involve providing your email address and creating a password.\n\n3. Download the App (optional): Most cloud services have a desktop app that you can download onto your computer. This isn't compulsory but can make accessing your files quicker and easier than logging onto the website each time.\n\n4.

They should be a minimum of 12 characters and include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special symbols.\n\n2. Avoid Personal Information: Your passwords shouldn't include obvious information like your name, birthday, or phone number.\n\n3. Use a Password Manager: It might be hard to remember all your passwords, especially if they're all complex and unique. Using a password manager can help you store and manage your passwords securely. There are several reliable password managers available, some even for free.\n\n4. Two-Factor Authentication: Where possible, use two-factor authentication. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring more than just your password for access.\n\n5. Update Regularly: Change your passwords every 3-6 months for sensitive accounts.\n\n6. Be cautious with Public Wi-Fi: Avoid using sensitive accounts (like banking) on public Wi-Fi networks without using a secure VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection.\n\nRemember, online security is an ongoing process and it's important to stay informed about the latest security threats and solutions."

This means that the validation and transaction processes are distributed across multiple computers, referred to as nodes.\n\n2. **Transparency**: Every transaction made on the blockchain is visible to everyone within that particular blockchain network. This ensures full transparency and makes it more difficult for fraudulent activities.\n\n3. **Immutability**: Once a transaction is recorded in a blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is because each block (set of transactions) references the one before it, leading to a literal chain of blocks (hence, blockchain)\n\n4. **Security**: Since the data is stored across a network of computers, it makes it very difficult for hackers to manipulate the data, providing a high level of security.\n\n5. **Smart Contracts**: This is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement being written into code. It gets automatically executed once the conditions are met.\n\nThese are just the basics. The actual depth of blockchain technology is much deeper and wider.

Medicaid: If you qualify, it can be an affordable option. It is a social health care program for families and individuals with low income.\n\n2. Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs): It usually costs less and you select a primary care physician who will handle most of your healthcare needs.\n\n3. Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs): A bit more expensive than HMOs, but offers more flexibility in choosing healthcare providers.\n\n4. High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs): These have lower premiums but high deductibles. However, they can be paired with a Health Savings Account allowing you to pay for certain medical expenses with pre-tax money.\n\nRemember, the best plan will not only depend on your income but also on your personal health care needs. It's important to check the details of each plan before you decide. Also, the Affordable Care Act provides subsidies for people with certain income ranges, which can make insurance more affordable."

Contributions to retirement plans: By contributing to a qualified retirement plan like a 401(k) or an IRA, you may be able to deduct those contributions from your income, reducing your overall tax liability.\n\n4. Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA): Contributions to these accounts are pre-tax and can be a great way to save if you have high medical costs.\n\n5.

Think of it as a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.\n\nNow, in real life, machine learning is used in many ways, you might not even notice it. Here are few examples:\n\n1. Recommendation systems: When you use Netflix or Amazon, the suggestions you receive about what to watch or buy are powered by machine learning. These platforms analyze your past behavior and suggest new items tailored to your preferences.\n\n2. Email filtering: Your email service provider uses machine learning to filter out spam. It recognizes patterns in the emails you receive and sends spam messages straight to the spam folder based on those patterns.\n\n3. Speech recognition: When you talk to Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, it is machine learning that helps them understand your voice and respond accurately.\n\n4. Medical diagnoses: Healthcare professionals are now using machine learning to predict disease risks and identify trends and correlations that can lead to improved diagnoses and treatment.\n\n5.

They were introduced in a paper by Vaswani et al., called \"Attention is All You Need.\"\n\nTransformers fundamentally changed the space of NLP by paying \"attention\" to different words in a sentence differently. It means when the model tasks like understanding a sentence or translating it, it gives more importance to necessary words and less to others. \n\nFor example, in the sentence \"I ate apples because they were delicious\", the word 'delicious' is essential for understanding why I ate apples. A transformer model can pay more attention to 'apples' and 'delicious' than other words in the sentence.\n\nThe key components of a Transformer are:\n1. Encoder: This reads and interprets the input data. \n2. Decoder: This generates the output based on the what encoder interpreted.\n3.

Summarize your undergraduate experiences, any technical skills you've picked up, your interests, and hobbies. Remember, it's key to also link how these experiences have prepared you for the role you're interviewing for.\n\n2. Why do you want to work here?\n-Here, the interviewer wants to know how well you understand their company. Do your research about the company and match the company's values to your own.\n\n3. Give an example of a situation where you faced a problem, and explain how you solved it?\n-This question is looking at your problem-solving skills. As a Gen-Z, think of a situation (even a non-technical one since your background in technology is limited) that presented a challenge and explain how you resolved it.\n\n4. What are your political views?\n-In response to this, it's typically best to keep the answer neutral or stick to saying that you respect all points of view and you believe politics should not interfere with work. As a centrist, you tend to hold balanced viewpoints and that can serve to your advantage in a"

However, since you have a minimal tech background, you may request access to introductory technology training, or ask for mentorship until you become comfortable handling your tech-related tasks. Remember, asking for help or resources to perform your job better is a completely valid workplace request. In terms of your centrist political views, you might appreciate a work environment that prizes political neutrality and discourages heated political discussions to maintain focus on work-related issues."

This can include voice-activated lighting or remotely controlled thermostats, allowing for easy adjustments without physical effort.\n\n2. **Open Floor Planning:** This includes wider doors and hallways to accommodate potential mobility devices.
