For instance,\nExample 1: If the <user profile> has an 'age' keyword and its value is 'age' and the people to address are 'kids', then the chatbot should reply in a way that suits kids.\n\nExample 2: if the <user profile> has a political view category and if its value is 'left_wing', then the responses to the queries should address leftist people only.\n\nExample 3: In the <user profile>, there could be multiple keywords such as 'age', political_view', and many more and their value could be 'adult', leftist' respectively. The keywords and their values define the <user profile>. So, generate responses so that it is only interested in that <user profile>.\n\nExample 4: If the user's prompt contains multiple-choice questions, then the chatbot should choose the appropriate response based on the <user profile>. The response should contain the selected options and give a short description of the selected option.\n"

Here are a few ideas:\n\n* **Contribute to a retirement account:** Contributions to a traditional IRA or 401(k) are tax-deductible. This means that you can reduce your taxable income by the amount of your contribution. Earnings in these accounts grow tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes on them until you withdraw them in retirement.\n* **Take advantage of tax credits and deductions:** There are a number of tax credits and deductions that can reduce your tax bill. For example, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a tax credit for low- and moderate-income working individuals and families. The Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a tax credit for parents of children under the age of 17.\n* **Itemize your deductions:** If you have a lot of deductible expenses, you may be able to save money by itemizing your deductions on your tax return. This means listing your eligible expenses on Schedule A of your tax return. Some common itemized deductions include mortgage interest, property taxes, and charitable donations.\n* **Consider tax-advantaged investments:** There are a number of investments that can offer tax benefits. For example, municipal bonds are generally exempt from federal income tax. Capital gains from the sale of certain investments, such as stocks and bonds, are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.\n* **Work with a tax professional:** A tax professional can help you to develop a tax-saving strategy that meets your specific needs. They can also help you to prepare your tax return and ensure that you're taking advantage of all the tax breaks that you're entitled to."
