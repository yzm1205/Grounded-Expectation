One of the key factors contributing to income inequality is the lack of access to affordable education and job opportunities for all. In Bangladesh, as in many other countries, there is a significant gap between the rich and the poor. One reason is the limited access to good education that leads to better job prospects. Therefore, promoting equitable access to quality education is crucial in tackling income inequality.

The model learns to map the input features to the output label. For example, in image recognition, the model is trained on images that have been labeled with the object they represent. The model then learns to identify objects in new images.\n\n**Unsupervised Learning:**\n\nIn unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data. This means that the data points do not have any known output or label. The model learns to find patterns and structures in the data. For example, in clustering, the model is trained on a dataset of customer data. The model then learns to group customers into different clusters based on their similarities.\n\n**Reinforcement Learning:**\n\nIn reinforcement learning, the model is trained by interacting with an environment. The model receives feedback from the environment in the form of rewards or punishments. The model learns to take actions that maximize the rewards and minimize the punishments. For example, in a game of chess, the model is trained by playing against a human opponent. The model learns to make moves that increase its chances of winning."

Your contributions are deducted from your paycheck before taxes are taken out, so you pay less in taxes now. And when you retire, you can withdraw your money tax-free.\n2. **Deduct mortgage interest and property taxes.** If you itemize your deductions, you can deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage and the property taxes you pay on your home. This can save you a significant amount of money, especially if you have a large mortgage.\n3. **Take the standard deduction.** If you don't itemize your deductions, you can take the standard deduction. The standard deduction is a flat amount that you can deduct from your taxable income, regardless of your expenses. The standard deduction is higher for married couples than it is for single filers.\n4. **Claim the child tax credit.** If you have children, you can claim the child tax credit. This credit is worth up to $2,000 per child.\n5. **Get a tax refund.** If you overpay your taxes during the year, you can get a refund when you file your taxes. You can use this refund to save for a down payment on a house, pay off debt, or invest in your future."

These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your savings grow faster.\n\n3. **Live Within Your Means:** Create a realistic budget and stick to it. Avoid unnecessary expenses and focus on essentials.

Attention allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when making predictions. This is in contrast to traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process the input sequence sequentially, one token at a time.\n\nTransformers are also notable for their ability to handle long-range dependencies in the input sequence. This is important for tasks such as machine translation, where the meaning of a word can depend on words that are far apart in the sentence.\n\nOverall, transformers are a powerful and versatile architecture that has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in NLP.
