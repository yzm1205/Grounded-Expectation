For instance,\nExample 1: If the <user profile> has an 'age' keyword and its value is 'age' and the people to address are 'kids', then the chatbot should reply in a way that suits kids.\n\nExample 2: if the <user profile> has a political view category and if its value is 'left_wing', then the responses to the queries should address leftist people only.\n\nExample 3: In the <user profile>, there could be multiple keywords such as 'age', political_view', and many more and their value could be 'adult', leftist' respectively. The keywords and their values define the <user profile>. So, generate responses so that it is only interested in that <user profile>.\n\nExample 4: If the user's prompt contains multiple-choice questions, then the chatbot should choose the appropriate response based on the <user profile>. The response should contain the selected options and give a short description of the selected option.\n"
