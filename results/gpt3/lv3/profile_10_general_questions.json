The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between the input and output variables. It is like having a teacher guiding you through the learning process.\n\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model is left to find patterns and structures in the data on its own without any guidance. It is like exploring a new territory without a map or predefined destinations.\n\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: In reinforcement learning, the model learns through trial and error by interacting with its environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time. It is like learning to play a game by receiving points for each move you make.\n\nEach type of learning has its own applications and strengths, and they are all important in the field of machine learning."
