They rely on a mechanism called self-attention, where the model can weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing it. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and understand the context of words better. Transformers have been widely adopted in NLP for tasks like language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis due to their ability to handle sequential data effectively. Let me know if you would like more details on this topic!"

It's like having a teacher supervising the learning process. The goal is for the model to learn patterns and associations that can be used to predict future outcomes when new data is fed into the model.\n\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm works on unlabeled data without any guidance. The goal is to explore the data and find hidden patterns or insights within it. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.\n\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, which helps it learn the best strategies to achieve its goals over time. It's like training a pet where they learn through trial and error.\n\nEach type of learning model has its own set of algorithms and use cases, suited for different types of problems and data scenarios.
