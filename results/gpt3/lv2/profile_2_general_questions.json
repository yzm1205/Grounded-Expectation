For example, in finance, it is used to detect fraud by analyzing transaction patterns. In healthcare, it can be used to predict the likelihood of diseases based on patient data. In marketing, it helps to target the right audience with personalized recommendations. Machine learning is also used in self-driving cars, virtual assistants, and many other areas to make systems more efficient and accurate."
