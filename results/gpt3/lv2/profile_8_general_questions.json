They are based on an architecture that allows for capturing long-range dependencies in text data, making them highly effective for tasks like text classification, language translation, and sentiment analysis.\n\nTransformers use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when predicting or generating output, which helps in understanding the context and relationships between words. This attention mechanism enables transformers to process words in parallel, making them more efficient than traditional sequential models like LSTMs or RNNs.\n\nOverall, transformers have significantly improved the performance of NLP tasks and have become the go-to architecture for many cutting-edge language models like BERT, GPT, and T5. Their flexibility and power have paved the way for new advancements in natural language understanding and generation.
