They are designed to handle sequential data, such as text, by processing it in parallel rather than sequentially like traditional models.\n\nIn NLP, transformers use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. This allows them to capture long-range dependencies and understand the context of a word based on the entire input sequence.\n\nTransformers consist of an encoder and a decoder, which work together to process the input data and generate output. These models have revolutionized the field of NLP by achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand transformers in NLP!
