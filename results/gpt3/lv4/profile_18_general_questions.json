They rely on a mechanism called \"attention\" to effectively capture relationships between different words in a sentence. This allows them to process words in parallel rather than sequentially, making them much faster than traditional sequential models like LSTMs or RNNs. \n\nIn NLP, transformers have been used in a variety of tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling. They are known for their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their scalability to process large amounts of text data.\n\nOverall, transformers have revolutionized the field of NLP and are widely considered state-of-the-art for many natural language processing tasks."
