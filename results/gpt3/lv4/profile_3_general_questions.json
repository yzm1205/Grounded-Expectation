It involves principles that are very different from classical physics, where particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, known as superposition, and can be entangled with each other, where the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. Quantum Physics also includes concepts like wave-particle duality, where particles exhibit both wave and particle properties, and uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be precisely determined simultaneously."

                "assistant": "I can certainly explain Transformers used in NLP. Transformers are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for sequences of data, such as text. They have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to their ability to effectively capture long-range dependencies in text data without the need for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n\nTransformers consist of an encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention mechanisms. The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence in tasks like language translation. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions, enabling better contextual understanding.\n\nWith their parallelizability and superior performance on various NLP tasks, Transformers have become the backbone of many state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT-3, and more. Their flexibility and effectiveness have made them a go-to choice for many NLP applications."
