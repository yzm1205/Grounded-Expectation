If one account is compromised, all your accounts with the same password could be at risk.\n\n3. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA where possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password.\n\n4. **Beware of Phishing Attempts:** Be cautious of emails, messages, or websites that ask for your personal information. Verify the source before clicking on any links or providing sensitive data.\n\n5. **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, antivirus software, and applications to patch any security vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Use a Password Manager:** Consider using a trusted password manager to securely store and manage your passwords. This can help you generate strong, unique passwords for each account.\n\n7. **Secure Your Devices:** Use a screen lock on your devices and enable features like Find My Device to locate or remotely"
