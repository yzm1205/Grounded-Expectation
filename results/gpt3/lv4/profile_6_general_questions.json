They rely on a mechanism called self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding and decoding text. This allows transformers to capture long-range dependencies in the text, making them very effective for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling. They have become the go-to architecture for many NLP tasks due to their ability to handle sequential data efficiently."
