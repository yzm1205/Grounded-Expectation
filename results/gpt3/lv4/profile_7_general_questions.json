They are based on a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. This attention mechanism enables transformers to capture long-range dependencies in text and has led to significant improvements in tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.\n\nTransformers consist of an encoder and a decoder, each made up of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks. During the training process, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence (in the case of language modeling tasks) or to translate a sentence from one language to another (in the case of machine translation tasks).\n\nOverall, transformers have become a cornerstone in NLP and have paved the way for more advanced models such as BERT, GPT-3, and T5. They have greatly improved the performance of NLP systems and continue to drive innovation in the field."

Transformers are a type of deep learning model that has gained significant popularity in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They rely on a mechanism called attention to weigh the influence of different words in a sentence when processing it. This attention mechanism allows transformers to capture dependencies regardless of their distance in the input sequence, making them particularly effective for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.\n\nWould you like to know more details about how transformers work in NLP?"
