It deals with phenomena that are often counterintuitive, such as superposition (where particles can exist in multiple states at once) and entanglement (where particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle will instantly influence the state of another, no matter how far apart they are). Quantum Physics plays a crucial role in fields like technology, computing, and even our understanding of the universe at a fundamental level."

They are designed to handle sequential data, like sentences or words in a text. Transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions or generating output.\n\nWould you like to know more details about how Transformers work in NLP?"
