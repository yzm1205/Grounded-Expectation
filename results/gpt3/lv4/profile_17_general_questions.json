In natural language processing (NLP), transformers are a type of deep learning model that was introduced in a paper called \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Transformers have gained popularity for their ability to handle sequential data more efficiently compared to previous models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.\n\nTransformers rely on a mechanism called self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the data more effectively. With the use of stacked self-attention layers and feedforward neural networks, transformers can learn complex patterns in language data without being limited by sequential processing.\n\nAs someone interested in NLP with a background in depression, you might find transformers particularly useful in tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, text generation, and more. Their flexibility and performance have made them a cornerstone in modern NLP research and applications."
