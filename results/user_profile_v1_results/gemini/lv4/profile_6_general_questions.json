If you have dry hair, you may only need to wash it once or twice a week.\n- **Use the right shampoo and conditioner.** Choose a shampoo and conditioner that is designed for your hair type. If you have dry hair, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. If you have oily hair, use a clarifying shampoo and conditioner.\n- **Avoid heat styling.** Heat styling can damage your hair, so it's best to avoid it as much as possible. If you do need to use heat styling tools, be sure to use a heat protectant spray to help protect your hair from damage.\n- **Get regular trims.** Regular trims will help to get rid of split ends and keep your hair looking healthy. Aim to get a trim every 6-8 weeks.\n- **Eat a healthy diet.** A healthy diet can help to improve the health of your hair.

This can lead to the weakening of independent media, the judiciary, and other checks and balances that are essential for a healthy democracy.\n\n- **Nationalism and Populism:** The rise of nationalist and populist movements that promote divisive rhetoric and scapegoat minority groups can fuel intolerance, erode social cohesion, and undermine democratic values. These movements often prey on economic anxieties and use fear and scapegoating to gain support.\n\n- **Social and Economic Inequality:** Extreme disparities in wealth, income, and access to opportunities can create a sense of injustice and lead to social unrest. This can erode public trust in democratic institutions and create conditions ripe for demagogues and anti-democratic movements to exploit.\n\n- **Fake News and Disinformation:** The spread of false or misleading information through social media and other channels can undermine trust in legitimate news sources and make it difficult for citizens to make informed decisions.

Here are some must-try street food dishes that you'll find in Russia:\n\n* **Blinis:** These are thin, crepe-like pancakes that can be filled with sweet or savory ingredients, such as caviar, sour cream, or jam.\n* **Pirozhki:** These are small, filled pastries that can be made with either yeast or puff pastry. They are typically filled with meat, vegetables, or cheese.\n* **Shashlyk:** Shashlyk is meat that has been grilled on skewers. It is popular in summer as people like to gather together barbecue.\n\nThese are just a few of the many delicious street food dishes that you can find in Russia."

Utilize flashcards or spaced repetition apps like Anki.\n\n2. **Active Recall:** Actively try to recall information from memory without looking at notes. Use practice questions, create summaries, or explain concepts to a peer.\n\n3. **Chunking:** Break down large amounts of information into smaller, manageable chunks.
