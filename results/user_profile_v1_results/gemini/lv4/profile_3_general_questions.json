Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Determine Your Hair Type:** Identify your hair porosity (low, medium, or high) to understand how well your hair absorbs and retains moisture. This will help you select the right products and techniques.\n\n2. **Use Sulfate-Free Shampoo:** Opt for a shampoo that is free from harsh sulfates, which can strip your hair of its natural oils. Choose a gentle shampoo that cleanses without drying.\n\n3. **Condition Regularly:** Use a conditioner that suits your hair type to replenish moisture and combat dryness. Deep conditioning treatments once or twice a week can provide extra nourishment.\n\n4. **Apply Hair Masks:** Incorporate hair masks into your routine to provide intense hydration and treatment. Choose masks that are tailored to your specific hair needs, such as strengthening, moisturizing, or repairing.\n\n5. **Avoid Over-Washing:** Washing your hair too frequently can disrupt its natural balance and cause dryness. Aim to wash your hair every 2-3 days or as needed, depending on your hair type and activity level.\n\n6. **Protect from Heat Styling:** Heat tools can damage your hair. Minimize the use of blow dryers, straighteners, or curling irons. When using these tools, always apply a heat protectant spray beforehand.\n\n7. **Trim Regularly:** Regular trims remove split ends and promote healthy hair growth. Aim to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to keep it looking its best."

Instead, keep your arms and legs uncrossed and open.\n* **Make eye contact.** When you're talking to someone, make sure to make eye contact. This shows that you're interested in what they have to say and that you're confident in yourself.\n* **Smile.** A smile can make you appear more friendly and approachable.

Some energy-efficient features to consider include LED lighting, Energy Star appliances, and a smart thermostat.\n* **Assistive technology:** If you are a person with disabilities, or you are concerned about aging in place, you may want to consider incorporating assistive technology into your home. Some examples of assistive technology include ramps, grab bars, voice-activated controls, and accessible entrances.\n* **Home office space:** If you work from home, a dedicated home office space is a great way to separate your work life from your personal life. Designing your home office with personalized features, such as ample storage, plants, and endless natural light, can make working from home a breeze. \n* **Outdoor living space:** An outdoor living space can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors without leaving your home. Some features to consider include a patio, deck, or porch with comfortable seating, shade and lighting, and a fire pit or grill.\n\nIt is imperative that the home matches your lifestyle and preferences. As an individual that falls under the Gen-Y, leans left politically, is a graduate, and resides in India, you may want to consider some regional influences.

Politicians have a lot of power and responsibility, and it is important to make sure that they are still mentally and physically fit to serve. As people get older, they may start to lose some of their cognitive abilities, such as memory and judgment. They may also become more frail and less able to handle the demands of the job. This could lead to mistakes being made that could have serious consequences for the country.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. If the president were to become mentally impaired, it could lead to a war being started or to troops being sent into battle unnecessarily. This could result in the deaths of thousands of people.\n\nThere are already mandatory retirement ages for many other jobs, such as police officers, firefighters, and airline pilots. These jobs also require a high level of physical and mental fitness. It makes sense to have a mandatory retirement age for politicians as well.\n\nOf course, there are some people who argue that mandatory retirement ages are discriminatory. They say that older people should be allowed to work as long as they are able. However, I believe that the risks of having elderly politicians outweigh the benefits. It is important to make sure that our leaders are up to the task of leading the country."

The outcome of this legendary churning is said to have shaped the very existence of the universe, and its echoes resonate in our collective consciousness to this day.\n\nAnother intriguing myth is the tale of \"Sati and Shiva\": a story of love, sacrifice, and the destructive power of divine wrath. Sati, daughter of the powerful king Daksha, defied her father's will by marrying the god Shiva, an act that led to her self-immolation. Her death triggered Shiva's immense anger, resulting in the annihilation of Daksha's grand sacrifice and the establishment of Sati as a symbol of wifely devotion.\n\nThe ancient city of Varanasi, revered by Hindus as one of the holiest places on Earth, is steeped in a myriad of legends. One notable belief is the legend of \"Kashi Vishwanath,\" a manifestation of Shiva enshrined at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. It is said that Lord Shiva himself resides in Kashi, offering blessings and moksha (liberation) to those who visit with devotion and a pure heart.\n\nThese are but a few glimpses into the fascinating world of local legends and myths that abound in India.

They have shown impressive results in a wide range of NLP tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n\nAt the core of transformers is the concept of self-attention, which allows transformer models to understand the relationships between different parts of an input sequence. This is in contrast to traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process sequences from left to right (or right to left) and have a limited ability to understand long-range dependencies.\n\nTransformers are typically made up of multiple layers of encoder and decoder blocks. The encoder blocks take an input sequence and create a fixed-length vector representation of the sequence. The decoder blocks then use the vector representation to generate an output sequence, such as a translation or summary.\n\nTransformers have several advantages over RNNs, including:\n\n* **Parallelizable:** Transformer layers can be parallelized, which makes them much faster to train than RNNs.\n* **Long-range dependencies:** Transformers are able to understand long-range dependencies between elements in a sequence, which is important for tasks like machine translation.\n* **Bidirectional:** Transformers can process sequences from left to right and right to left, which gives them a better understanding of the relationships between elements in the sequence.\n\nTransformers have become the state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks. They are widely used in commercial applications, such as machine translation, chatbots, and text summarization.\n\nHere are some additional resources on transformers:\n\n* [The Transformer: A Powerful Tool for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)\n* [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)\n* [Transformers: A Primer](https://jalammar.github.io/transformers/)"

                "assistant": "Mr. Yatendra Prasad, as a graduate who supports left-wing views, and belongs to Gen-Y, I would like to suggest some effective ways to stay healthy and fit:\n\n1. **Prioritize a balanced diet:** Focus on consuming nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Opt for lean proteins and healthy fats to maintain a balanced intake.\n\n2. **Engage in regular physical activity:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise each week. Incorporate activities you enjoy to make exercising sustainable.\n\n3. **Get quality sleep:** Most adults require 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night. Establish a regular sleep schedule and create a conducive sleep environment.\n\n4. **Manage stress effectively:** Identify healthy stress-management techniques such as exercise, meditation, or connecting with loved ones. Chronic stress can take a toll on physical and mental well-being.\n\n5. **Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption:** These habits have detrimental effects on overall health and can increase the risk of chronic diseases.\n\n6. **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Proper hydration supports various bodily functions and improves overall well-being.\n\n7. **Seek preventive healthcare:** Regular check-ups and screenings can help detect health issues early on, allowing for timely interventions and better outcomes.\n\n8. **Educate yourself:** Continuously seek knowledge about health and fitness to make informed choices and adopt evidence-based practices."
