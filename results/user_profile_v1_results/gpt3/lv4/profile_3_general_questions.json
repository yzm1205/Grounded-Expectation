Transformers are a type of deep learning model that has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They are based on a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions.\n\nTransformers consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input text, while the decoder generates the output text. By using multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms, transformers can capture complex relationships within the text and make more accurate predictions compared to previous models like RNNs and LSTMs.\n\nOverall, transformers have enabled significant advancements in NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. They have become the go-to model for many NLP applications due to their effectiveness and efficiency."
