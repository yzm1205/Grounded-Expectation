This attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input text while generating an output. Transformers also utilize self-attention layers that can capture dependencies between different words in a sequence, making them powerful for handling long-range dependencies in language data.\n\nBy using transformers, NLP tasks can be performed more efficiently and accurately compared to traditional models like RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) or LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks). They have been the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models such as BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa.\n\nIf you're interested in diving deeper into how transformers work or their specific applications in NLP, feel free to ask for more details!"
