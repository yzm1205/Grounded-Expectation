They are designed to handle sequential data, such as language, in a more efficient and effective manner.\n\nIn the context of NLP, transformers utilize an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing the text. This attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input text when generating an output, making it very powerful for tasks like language translation, text summarization, and language understanding.\n\nTransformers consist of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input text and generates a representation of it, while the decoder takes that representation and produces the output text. This architecture enables transformers to handle tasks that require understanding and generating text in a coherent manner.\n\nOverall, transformers have revolutionized the field of NLP by enabling more accurate and efficient models for various language-related tasks."
