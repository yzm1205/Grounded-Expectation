Transformers consist of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input data and the decoder generates the output.\n\nIn the context of NLP, transformers have revolutionized the field by outperforming traditional models in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. They achieve this by learning contextual relationships between words in a sentence through self-attention mechanisms.\n\nThese self-attention mechanisms allow transformers to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating an output, making them highly effective in understanding the context and meaning of a given text. Transformers have shown remarkable success in various NLP tasks and continue to be a key component in modern NLP models.\n\nAs a right-wing individual from Gen-Y in India, you might find it interesting to know that transformers are enabling advancements in technology that improve language processing capabilities, leading to more efficient communication and analysis of textual data."
