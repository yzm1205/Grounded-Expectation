In quantum physics, many phenomena are described by probabilities and uncertainties rather than deterministic outcomes. This leads to concepts like superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, where particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is instantly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. Quantum physics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of particles at the quantum level and has led to the development of technologies like quantum computers and quantum cryptography."

They are designed to handle sequential data, such as text, by processing the data in parallel rather than sequentially like traditional models. Transformers use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data when making predictions, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively. This architecture has led to significant advancements in tasks like machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. If you're interested in delving deeper into the technical details, I can provide more information."
