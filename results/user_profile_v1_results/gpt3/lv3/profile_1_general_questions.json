This allows them to capture long-range dependencies and understand the context of each word within a sentence.\n\nTransformers have become popular due to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks. They are widely used in pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-3, and RoBERTa, which can be fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks with relatively small amounts of data.\n\nOverall, transformers have significantly advanced the capabilities of NLP models, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy and fluency."
