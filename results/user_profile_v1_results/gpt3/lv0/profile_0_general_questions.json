It describes the fundamental properties of these particles and how they interact with each other and with their surrounding environment.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum physics is the concept of wave-particle duality, which states that particles such as electrons and photons can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior depending on the experimental setup. This duality is captured by the wave function, a mathematical description that predicts the probability of finding a particle in a particular state.\n\nQuantum physics also involves the idea of superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement is made and a specific state is observed. This leads to the concept of quantum entanglement, where particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, even when they are separated by vast distances.\n\nQuantum physics has given rise to a number of important technologies, such as lasers, semiconductors, and quantum computing.

The transformer model was introduced in a seminal paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017, which described a new architecture called the Transformer for sequence-to-sequence modeling.\n\nKey components of transformer models include:\n\n1. Self-attention mechanism: The transformer model uses self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. This mechanism allows the model to consider all the words in the input sequence simultaneously and capture long-range dependencies effectively.\n\n2. Multi-head attention: Transformers use multiple sets of attention mechanisms, known as \"heads,\" to capture different features and relationships in the input. This results in the model being able to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n\n3. Positional encoding: Since transformers do not inherently understand the sequential order of words in a sentence, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide the model with information about the position of words in the sequence.\n\n4.
