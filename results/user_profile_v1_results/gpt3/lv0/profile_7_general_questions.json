It describes the nature of particles, energy, and matter at this scale, where classical physics laws no longer apply.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum physics is the concept of quantization, which states that certain properties of particles, such as energy and momentum, can only take on discrete values or \"quanta.\" This is in contrast to classical physics, where these properties were considered continuous.\n\nAnother important principle of quantum physics is the wave-particle duality, which suggests that particles such as electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the context. This duality is captured by the wave function, a mathematical function that describes the probability of finding a particle in a particular state.\n\nQuantum physics also introduces the concept of superposition, where a particle can exist in multiple states at the same time until it is measured or observed. This leads to phenomena such as quantum entanglement, where particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly affects the state of another, regardless of the distance between them.\n\nOverall, quantum physics has profoundly influenced our understanding of the fundamental"

In the context of natural language processing (NLP), transformers refer to a type of neural network architecture that has been very successful in various NLP tasks. \n\nTransformers were introduced in a groundbreaking paper called \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The key innovation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing the input. This mechanism enables transformers to capture long-range dependencies in the input text, which was challenging for previous NLP models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).\n\nTransformers consist of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each layer, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. The feedforward neural networks help to further process the information extracted by the self-attention mechanism.\n\nTransformers have been used in a wide range of NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis.
