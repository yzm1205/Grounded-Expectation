In the field of natural language processing (NLP), transformers are a type of deep learning model that has revolutionized the way computers process and understand language. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing it, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies in the data. This makes transformers highly effective for tasks such as machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, and more. They are known for their ability to generalize well to new tasks and their scalability to handle large amounts of data. Transformers have become the state-of-the-art architecture in many NLP applications due to their performance and flexibility."
