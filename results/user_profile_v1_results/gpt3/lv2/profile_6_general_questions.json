They are known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them very effective for tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation.\n\nIn NLP, transformers consist of an encoder and a decoder, both of which are built using self-attention mechanisms. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when making predictions, enabling it to better understand the context of a word based on its surrounding words.\n\nTransformers have revolutionized the field of NLP by outperforming previous models on a wide range of tasks. They are often pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks, which helps them achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the concept of transformers in NLP for you!
