They are known for their ability to handle long-range dependencies and capture contextual information effectively. Transformers use a mechanism called self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions.\n\nThese models consist of an encoder and a decoder, with multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms. The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence. By training on large amounts of text data, transformers can learn intricate patterns in language and perform tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question-answering.\n\nOverall, transformers have drastically improved the performance of NLP tasks and are widely used in various applications due to their efficiency and effectiveness in capturing complex linguistic relationships."
