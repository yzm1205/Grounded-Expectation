This means that energy and matter can't be divided into smaller and smaller pieces. They can only exist in whole units, like photons of light or electrons.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum physics is superposition. This is the idea that particles can exist in multiple states at the same time. For example, an electron can be both a wave and a particle at the same time. This is different from classical physics, where objects can only exist in one state at a time.\n\nQuantum physics is a very complex subject, but it's also very important.

Here's how you can protect yourself:\n\n* **Be password-smart:** Make sure your passwords are hard to guess by using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Don't use the same password for multiple accounts. Password managers can help!\n* **Stay software-updated:** Install security updates as soon as you can. These patches fix bugs that attackers can use to sneak onto your devices.\n* **Be careful with links and attachments:** Don't click on links or open attachments unless you know who sent them. They could take you to virus-filled websites or download malware.\n* **Use a good antivirus program:** Get an antivirus or security suite to help you find and remove viruses, spyware, and other nasties. Make sure to keep it updated too.\n* **Think before connecting!:** Be careful when using public Wi-Fi networks, as they can be less secure. Consider using a VPN (virtual private network) to add extra protection.\n* **Be smart about social media:** Don't share personal info or open messages from people you don't know. Privacy settings are your friends!\n* **Talk to a trusted grown-up:** If you're not sure about something or worried about an online threat, tell a parent, teacher, or another trusted adult. They can help you stay safe and secure."

Avoid using common words or phrases, and don't include any personal information like your name or birthday.\n* **Store your passwords securely.** Don't write them down or share them with anyone! Use a password manager app to store your passwords securely and access them from any device.\n* **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).** 2FA is an extra layer of security that requires you to enter a code from your phone or email when you log in to your accounts. This makes it much harder for hackers to break into your accounts, even if they have your password.\n* **Be careful about what information you share online.** Don't give out your passwords or personal information to anyone you don't know and trust.
