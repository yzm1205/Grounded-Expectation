They are based on a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence when making predictions.\n\nInstead of processing words in a sentence sequentially like traditional RNNs or LSTMs, transformers can process all words in the sentence simultaneously. This parallel processing of words makes transformers much faster and more efficient for NLP tasks.\n\nIn the context of NLP, transformers have revolutionized tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. They have achieved state-of-the-art results in many benchmark datasets and are widely used in production systems for various NLP applications."
