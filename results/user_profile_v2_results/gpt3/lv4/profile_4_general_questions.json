In quantum physics, particles such as electrons and photons can exist in multiple states at once, a phenomenon known as superposition. Additionally, quantum physics introduces the concept of entanglement, where particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle will directly affect the state of another, no matter the distance between them. These concepts form the basis of many modern technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography."

They rely on a self-attention mechanism to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence. Transformers are made up of an encoder-decoder architecture with multiple layers, allowing them to capture complex patterns in language data. With their ability to handle long-range dependencies effectively, transformers have become the state-of-the-art models for various NLP tasks like language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. The transformer architecture was introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.\n\nIf you want a more detailed explanation on any specific aspect of transformers in NLP, feel free to ask!"
