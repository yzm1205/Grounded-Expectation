Additionally, particles can also be connected in a phenomenon called entanglement, where the state of one particle can instantly affect the state of another, no matter the distance between them. Overall, quantum physics is a fascinating and mind-boggling field of study that challenges our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level."

They utilize self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing it. This helps transformers capture long-range dependencies in text data, making them very effective in tasks like language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. In simpler terms, transformers are like super smart machines that can understand and generate human language much better than traditional models."

It's like exploring and finding patterns on your own.\n\nReinforcement learning is a bit different - it's all about training an agent to make sequences of decisions by rewarding or punishing it based on its actions.
