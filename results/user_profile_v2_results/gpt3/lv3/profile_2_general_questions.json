In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), transformers are a type of deep learning model that has revolutionized the way we process and understand language. They are designed to handle sequential data, such as sentences or paragraphs, by utilizing self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions.\n\nOne of the key advancements of transformers is their ability to learn long-range dependencies in text, allowing them to capture context and relationships across different parts of a sentence. This has led to significant improvements in tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation.\n\nTransformers consist of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder analyzes the input text and the decoder generates the output text. By leveraging multiple stacked layers of self-attention mechanisms, transformers can effectively process and understand complex language patterns.\n\nOverall, transformers have become a cornerstone technology in NLP, enabling more accurate and efficient language processing tasks."
