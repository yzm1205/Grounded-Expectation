They are designed to handle sequential data, such as text, by processing it in parallel rather than sequentially like traditional RNNs or LSTMs. Transformers consist of an encoder and a decoder, with attention mechanisms that allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating an output.\n\nTransformers have greatly improved the performance of NLP models by enabling them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and scale to larger datasets. They have been used in various NLP tasks like machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Transformers are at the core of models like BERT, GPT, and T5, which have achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP benchmarks."
