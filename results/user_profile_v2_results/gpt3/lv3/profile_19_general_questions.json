They are based on a self-attention mechanism that allows them to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence when making predictions.\n\nTransformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies in language and can be easily scaled to process large amounts of text data. They have been used in various NLP tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.\n\nTheir architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder processes the input text and the decoder generates the output text. Each layer in the transformer model contains multiple attention heads, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n\nOverall, transformers have significantly improved the state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks and are widely used in many applications that involve understanding and generating human language."
