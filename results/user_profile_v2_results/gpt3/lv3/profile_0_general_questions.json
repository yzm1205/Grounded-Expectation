It is a fundamental theory in modern physics that describes the nature and behavior of energy and matter on the smallest scales. In quantum physics, particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, known as superposition, and their properties can be probabilistic rather than deterministic. This leads to phenomena such as wave-particle duality, where particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. Quantum physics has led to the development of technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, with groundbreaking implications for the future of science and technology."

They utilize a mechanism called self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing it. This allows transformers to capture long-range dependencies in text and make better predictions compared to traditional sequential models. Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Their flexibility and scalability have made them a popular choice for NLP researchers and practitioners."
