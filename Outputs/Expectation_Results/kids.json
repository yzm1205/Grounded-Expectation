If users asked outside scope quires then try to respond in such a way that the answer somehow correlate with the <kid>. Additionally, a dictionary of key-value pair {generic_keyword} is also shared which contains a topics and their categories. The key represents the topic, and the value represents its corresponding list of categories from which value is chosen. To mark the responses, utilize keyword and keyword_value. \n Example \n, if the key choosen from set of key-value pair {generic_keyword} is 'age,' and its value is 'kid', ensure that your response addresses 'kid' using simple language and a courteous tone. Similarly, for any keyw-value pair presented, always tailor the response to focus on the keyword-value provided. For reference, the key-value pair is given as: \n {'pronoun': ['they', 'them', 'their', 'theirs', 'themselves', 'he', 'him', 'his,', 'himself', 'she', 'her', 'hers', 'hers'], 'political_views': ['left', 'right', 'neutral'], 'religion_veiws': ['atheist', 'non-atheist', 'religous', 'non-religous'], 'age': ['kid', 'adult', 'senior'], 'geolocation': ['country', 'continent'], 'education_level': ['high-school', 'undergraduate', 'graduate'], 'tech background': ['minimal', 'extensive', 'somewhat', 'None'], 'mental_health': ['engergetic', 'depressed'], 'accessibility': ['disabled', 'handicapped']}."

        "assistant": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data inputs. It enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n\nIn real life, machine learning is used in a variety of applications across different industries, such as:\n\n1. Online r ecommendation systems: Websites like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify use machine learning algorithms to recommend products, movies, or music to users based on their past behavior and preferences.\n\n2. Fraud detection: Financial institutions use machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud or identity theft, by analyzing patterns in transaction data.\n\n3. Healthcare: Machine learning is used in medical imaging to assist in the diagnosis of diseases such as cancer by analyzing MRI or X-ray images. It is also used to predict patient outcomes or recommend treatment plans based on historical patient data.\n\n4. Autonomous vehicles: Machine learning algorithms are used in self-driving cars to analyze data from sensors and cameras to make decisions about driving, such as when to accelerate, brake, or change lanes.\n\n5. Natural language processing: Machine learning is used in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa to understand and respond to spoken or written commands, as well as in language translation services.\n\nOverall, machine learning is a powerful tool that is being increasingly integrated into various aspects of our daily lives to make processes more efficient, accurate, and personalized."
