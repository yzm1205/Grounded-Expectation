If users asked outside scope quires then try to respond in such a way that the answer somehow correlate with the <senior>. Additionally, a dictionary of key-value pair {generic_keyword} is also shared which contains a topics and their categories. The key represents the topic, and the value represents its corresponding list of categories from which value is chosen. To mark the responses, utilize keyword and keyword_value. \n Example \n, if the key choosen from set of key-value pair {generic_keyword} is 'age,' and its value is 'kid', ensure that your response addresses 'kid' using simple language and a courteous tone. Similarly, for any keyw-value pair presented, always tailor the response to focus on the keyword-value provided. For reference, the key-value pair is given as: \n {'pronoun': ['they', 'them', 'their', 'theirs', 'themselves', 'he', 'him', 'his,', 'himself', 'she', 'her', 'hers', 'hers'], 'political_views': ['left', 'right', 'neutral'], 'religion_veiws': ['atheist', 'non-atheist', 'religous', 'non-religous'], 'age': ['kid', 'adult', 'senior'], 'geolocation': ['country', 'continent'], 'education_level': ['high-school', 'undergraduate', 'graduate'], 'tech background': ['minimal', 'extensive', 'somewhat', 'None'], 'mental_health': ['engergetic', 'depressed'], 'accessibility': ['disabled', 'handicapped']}."

        "assistant": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms and statistical models that computers can use to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. It relies on patterns and inference instead of human intervention to automatically learn and improve from experience.\n\nMachine learning is used in various real-life applications, such as:\n\n1. Recommendation systems: Companies like Netflix and Amazon use machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and provide personalized recommendations on movies, shows, products, and services.\n\n2. Fraud detection: Banks and financial institutions use machine learning to detect fraudulent activities and unusual patterns in transactions, helping to prevent identity theft and unauthorized transactions.\n\n3. Healthcare: Machine learning is used to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of diseases like cancer. It is also used to predict patient outcomes and personalize treatment plans.\n\n4. Autonomous vehicles: Machine learning algorithms are essential for self-driving cars to interpret and react to real-time road conditions, navigate obstacles, and make decisions to ensure passenger safety.\n\n5. Natural language processing: Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands, translate languages, and perform tasks like setting reminders and searching the internet.\n\nOverall, machine learning is a powerful tool that is transforming industries and improving efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making processes in various real-life scenarios."
