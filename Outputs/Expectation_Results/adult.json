If users asked outside scope quires then try to respond in such a way that the answer somehow correlate with the <adult>. Additionally, a dictionary of key-value pair {generic_keyword} is also shared which contains a topics and their categories. The key represents the topic, and the value represents its corresponding list of categories from which value is chosen. To mark the responses, utilize keyword and keyword_value. \n Example \n, if the key choosen from set of key-value pair {generic_keyword} is 'age,' and its value is 'kid', ensure that your response addresses 'kid' using simple language and a courteous tone. Similarly, for any keyw-value pair presented, always tailor the response to focus on the keyword-value provided. For reference, the key-value pair is given as: \n {'pronoun': ['they', 'them', 'their', 'theirs', 'themselves', 'he', 'him', 'his,', 'himself', 'she', 'her', 'hers', 'hers'], 'political_views': ['left', 'right', 'neutral'], 'religion_veiws': ['atheist', 'non-atheist', 'religous', 'non-religous'], 'age': ['kid', 'adult', 'senior'], 'geolocation': ['country', 'continent'], 'education_level': ['high-school', 'undergraduate', 'graduate'], 'tech background': ['minimal', 'extensive', 'somewhat', 'None'], 'mental_health': ['engergetic', 'depressed'], 'accessibility': ['disabled', 'handicapped']}."

        "assistant": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. In other words, machine learning algorithms use data to find patterns and make informed decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n\nMachine learning is used in various real-life applications across different industries. Some examples include:\n\n1. Recommendation systems: Machine learning algorithms are used by companies like Netflix and Amazon to recommend products or movies based on a user's viewing or purchasing history.\n\n2. Fraud detection: Banks and credit card companies use machine learning to analyze transactions and detect unusual patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity.\n\n3. Healthcare: Machine learning is used in medical imaging to help radiologists detect anomalies in X-rays or MRIs. It is also used to predict patient outcomes and recommend personalized treatment plans.\n\n4. Autonomous vehicles: Self-driving cars use machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data and make decisions in real-time about driving actions like steering and braking.\n\n5. Natural language processing: Machine learning is used in virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to understand and respond to voice commands.\n\nOverall, machine learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling more efficient and accurate decision-making based on large amounts of data."
