# Key Points
- **In-context learning**: When additional information like input-output samples are provided with prompts of the LLMs for demonstrating for a specific task. Basically, ICL helps pre-trained model to learn quickly without fine-tuning the model. Additionally, the knowledge learning my model via ICL is temporary i.e model will lose information after the inference. 

- **Few-shot**: It also help model to generalize with limited I/O smaples. However, the examples provided here may not be natural language i.e the examples could focus on formating, type of different output responses other than language itself like image.
